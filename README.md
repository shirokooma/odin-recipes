# odin-recipes
This project consists of a basic recipe website. It contains a main index page with several links to a few recipe pages. It is my first project. It demonstrates my skills in html and css so far. These skills include creating a boilerplate, working with headings and paragraphs, working with lists, and working with links and images. Additionally, they include working with git and writing commit messages.
